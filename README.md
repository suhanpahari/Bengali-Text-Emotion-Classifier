## Project Information

### Fine-tuned BERT Model

The fine-tuned BERT model (my_bert_model.h5) has been trained on a dataset specifically designed for emotion classification. This model uses the BERT architecture to capture complex semantic relationships in the text. It is loaded with custom layers to handle the BERT encoding and used for predictions in the Streamlit application. This model is capable of understanding context and nuances in Bengali text.

### Random Forest Model

The Random Forest model utilizes a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features before classification. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and robustness. It is a reliable model for emotion classification, providing a straightforward approach to handle diverse text inputs.

### SVM Model

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, similar to the Random Forest model, uses a TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are known for their performance in classification tasks. This model separates different emotion classes by finding an optimal hyperplane.

### Logistic Regression Model

The Logistic Regression model uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform text data into feature vectors. This model is a popular choice for classification problems due to its simplicity and efficiency. It calculates probabilities to predict the emotion class of the input text.

### Naive Bayes Model

The Naive Bayes model, also based on a TF-IDF vectorizer, employs a probabilistic approach to emotion classification. This model assumes independence between features, making it computationally efficient. It is effective for text classification tasks where the independence assumption holds reasonably well.

### Streamlit Application

The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for emotion classification. Users can input a sentence in Bengali and choose from different models, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, BERT Fine-Tuned, and Naive Bayes. The application displays the predicted emotion along with the model's confidence score. It is designed for ease of use and accessibility, making emotion classification interactive and straightforward.

### Tokenization with mBERT

For tokenization, the project uses mBERT (Multilingual BERT) with the bert-base-multilingual-uncased variant. This choice enables handling multiple languages efficiently and improves the accuracy of the emotion classification models.
